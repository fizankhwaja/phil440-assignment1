    <h2 class="title-toggle">McLuhan's Idea </h2>
    <p class="hidden">McLuhan's Idea of electric light being the medium without a message, discusses how modes of communication in of themselves do not have a message. 
        It's role is to reveal the message conveyed through the medium, similar to a blank canvas. 
        We accept light as it comes, mostly without thinking. However, McLuhan argues that every medium (or technology) has an effect on society, and "exerts power on the world," as described in the lecture video "The Message." Electric light shifts our schedules, redefines rest, and transformed safety. 
        In a way, electric light does hold a message, one so common to us that it fades into the background. That's what McLuhan means, the electric light is a medium
        without content. It's the absence of content, which delivers everything else.

    <h2 class="title-toggle">Medium Analysis</h2>
    <p class="hidden">I chose to utilize a website to complete this assignment for two reasons. One, because I'm a computer science major, and I enjoy the process of expressing
        ideas through technology. The second is because after pondering on what other mediums mimic the idea of electric light, a common medium that has become so 
        easily invisible to us. We browse websites all day, without realizing the work that goes into the structures and aesthetics that go into delivering the 
        information readily available at our fingertips. After thinking about how to convey ideas beyond a written paper, I realized that websites mirror the idea 
        of an electric light: they rarely have their own content, rather they host ideas and/or information, just like how electric lights deliver information without
        itself delivering a message.

    <h2 class="title-toggle">Assignment Purpose</h2>
    <p class="hidden"> In building this assignment, I noticed how design choices, such as color, layout, button interactivity, affected user experience. Even with minimal text, the site's form sends a message
        -- echoing McLuhan's point that media shapes us whether we recognize it or not. By disallowing a traditional paper response, the assignment forces us to notice the medium in which the message/content 
        is being conveyed through. We get a taste of McLuhans claim that the overt message is dependent on the specific medium.
